# Prompt 1

I wish to design an evolutionary algorithm that attempts to solve the travelling salesman problem.

-> INITIALIZATION : Use random selection to create the initial population
-> SELECTION : I want K-tournament selection with k=5
-> MUTATION : Swap mutation
-> CROSSOVER : I want to go with order crossover with random substring lengths

For ELIMINATION, I want to keep it simple but add 3% elitism
For the stopping criteria stop if the max generations have been reached or there are no more improvements


# Prompt 2

Not getting a good objective value with this algorithm, can you add inversion mutation
